# Unified Interface to Numerical Relativity Catalogs

This library provides a unified interface to various catalogs
of Numerical Relativity simulations of binary black hole mergers.
At the moment of writing, different research groups have separate
formats of data and/or tools to interface with them. This library
will be a thin layer atop those for convenience of downstream
work.
